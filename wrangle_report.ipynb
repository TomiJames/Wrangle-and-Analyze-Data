    "1. The main data used is the **WeRateDogs twitter archive** that was downloaded manually as a `.csv` file from the Udacity learning platform. This was then read into a pandas dataframe using the `pd.read_csv` method.\n",
    "2. In order to get the breed of the dog for each tweet, the **image prediction data** for the each tweet was downloaded programmatically as a `.tsv` file from where it was hosted using the `requests` library. This data was also read into a pandas dataframe using the same method decribed above.\n",
    "3. To complement the main data gotten, other information about the tweets were gotten from Twitter API using `tweepy` library. The json data was read into a text file named `'tweet_json.txt'` which was then parsed into a list of dictionaries. This list was then converted into a dataframe using the `pd.\n",

    "In this stage, the three dataframes were assessed visually and programmatically for cleaniness issues. 8 quality issues and 3 tidiness issues were identified in this stage. The cleaniness issues are listed below:\n",
    "##### Quality Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The records with non-null values in the `retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id` and `retweeted_status_timestamp` columns are retweets and not original tweets.\n",
    "2. The records with non-null values in the `in_reply_to_status_id` and `in_reply_to_user_id` columns are replies and not original tweets.\n",
    "3. The `source` column carries the html anchor tag instead of just the tweet source.\n",
    "4. The `name` column contains wrong names for some of the dogs. An example is the record in index `2352`.\n",
    "5. Some other columns asides the ones listed above are null but instead of `NaN`, we have 'None'. This will make working with null data difficult as we continue our analysis.\n",
    "6. The `timestamp` and `retweeted_status_timestamp` columns have their datatypes as `object` rather than `datetime64[ns]`.\n",
    "7. Only about 10% of the records in the `in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id` and `retweeted_status_timestamp` columns are not null.\n",
    "8. In the `image_df`, the case of the predictions is not consistent. Some are lower case while some others are title case.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tidiness Issues\n",
    "1. The `twitter_df` and `tweepy_df` have more rows than the `image_df`. This means some tweets don't have image predictions and might have to be dropped.\n",
    "2. The `retweet_count` and `favorite_count` columns from the `tweepy_df`should be in the `twitter_df` instead.\n",
    "3. The `twitter_df` contains both information about the tweets and the type of dog. The type of dog should be contained in a separate dataset."
